Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered Then does it more From his endorsement of Bannon Support for the Klansmen Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black And comes home from Iraq And is still told to go back to Africa Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for Tryna use your platform or your stature To try to give those a voice who don't have one He says, \"You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!\" Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered 'Cause to him you're zeros 'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured That's not disrespectin' the military Fuck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist! And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch! \"He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!\" \"He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!\" Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks 'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks 'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this: Fuck you! The rest of America, stand up! We love our military, and we love our country But we fuckin' hate Trump!"

You'll never be mine, remember the time I came to see you? I thought it would just be you, but there's twelve other people You see there was never \"We\" so we could never be a sequel Thought it might've been a date the day, did anything to see you But I'm nothing more than nothing, you're bluffing saying you care Our only real connection is memories that we share I would never try to blame you, cause blaming you isn't fair Not that you care, the stress is really starting to wear And in my music, I took our story and I used it Don't care how you were feeling, I'm busy dropping my new shit Know people gonna love it, I'm buzzing after I do it I'm gifted with the curse of honesty and the truth is I loved you more than words, I didn't know how to prove it Can't tell you that in person, but always could through my music Everyone who said they cared isn't there, now I'm confused I'm broken and bruised, lonely, open, empty and stupid and still I  I thought I had it all figured out No, you would never fall for me now I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now  And I can't lie, it hurt a little when you said you didn't want me To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me Every pic I see is you and him, his twitter tryna taunt me You think I let it go? This is old and exhausting Some offspring family in a house is what I thought about Sometimes I wonder if he'll get that now See we know that you picked a different path Me I picked a different route And I can't help but laugh at how this all played out You're over me now, I'm hoping you found only the best Remember when we used to rep that Kanye West? Graduation and rotation cause you liked that best And back then I didn't want you, now look I'm a mess I open my chest, look through me, you can see no spine My profile pic and lyrics I've been hiding behind It looks like you found the love that I was hoping to find The only you I love is the one that I create in my mind and still I  I thought I had it all figured out No, you would never fall for me now I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now",
